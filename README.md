# Unsupervised_learning_algorithm_comparisons
## Comparison of various clusturing algorithms


- I this notebook , various algorithms will be compaired 
- this will help to determine the best clustering algorithm for the used dataset.
- Information about the dataset used is found in the notebook
- Silhoute and bould davies scores were used to compaire the agorithms
- At first in order to determine the range of k clusters , elbow curve using KMEANS and silhoute score using gaussian mixture was used.
